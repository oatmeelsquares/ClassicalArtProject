# Classical Art Project

Project report: [DL_Project_Milestone_III.pdf](https://github.com/oatmeelsquares/ClassicalArtProject/blob/main/DL_Project_Milestone_III.pdf)

This report describes the team's experiments using Python, TensorFlow and Keras 
to build a neural network to classify the culture, medium, and time period of 
various pictures of ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian art. Our goal was to use 
deep convolutional networks, transfer learning, and advanced architecture to 
classify photos of artwork. In the end, we achieved modest results with about 
50% accuracy in the final model.

Code is stored on UVA's supercomputer and may be uploaded in the future.
